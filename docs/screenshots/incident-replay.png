# Placeholder for: docs/screenshots/incident-replay.png

This file should be replaced with a high-resolution screenshot of the **Incident Replay Mode** feature from the running application.

**Ideal Screenshot:**
* Shows the map view.
* Clearly shows the timeline/scrubber UI at the bottom of the screen.
* Highlights an event (like a "Critical" incident) on the map.
* The "Replay Controls" (play, pause, speed) are visible.
