# Placeholder for: docs/screenshots/dashboard.png

This file should be replaced with a high-resolution screenshot of the main **Digital Twin Dashboard** from the running application.

**Ideal Screenshot:**
* Showcases the dark-mode UI.
* Map is visible with several sensor markers (green, yellow, red).
* KPI widgets (e.g., "Active Incidents," "System Status") are visible.
* The "Live Incidents" list is on the side.
* Looks clean, professional, and data-rich.
