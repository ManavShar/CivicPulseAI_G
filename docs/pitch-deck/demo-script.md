# 🎬 CivicPulse AI: Cinematic Demo Script
# (Total Time: ~90 Seconds)

**Operator:** "Good morning. We're here to show you CivicPulse AI, the autonomous operating system for your city. You're looking at the **live digital twin** of our city."

**(Action: Point to the main dashboard map. Markers are pulsing gently. Data is ticking up.)**

**Operator:** "We're not just looking at a static map. We are monitoring the live health of hundreds of pieces of infrastructure—from waste and lighting to water and traffic. Everything is stable... but our AI is designed to look for problems *before* they happen."

**(Action: Point to the "Predictions" widget.)**

**Operator:** "And here, our system has just predicted a problem. It's forecasting that 'Trash Bin 4A' in the city park will overflow within the next 2 hours."

**(Action: Click on the prediction. The map zooms to the flashing "predicted" incident marker.)**

**Operator:** "This is where the magic happens. A normal city would wait for a complaint. Our city *acts*."

**(Action: Switch to the "Agent Console" screen. New messages are appearing.)**

**Operator:** "The instant the prediction was made, our AI **Planner Agent** analyzed the situation. You can read its thoughts right here: *'High-priority waste incident in a public park. Risk of public complaint is high. Recommending immediate dispatch.'*"

**(Action: Point to the next message in the console.)**

**Operator:** "And our **Dispatcher Agent** has already picked it up, created Work Order 452, and assigned it to the 'Sanitation Bravo' team. The problem is being solved *before* it's even a problem."

**(Action: Switch back to the main map. Click the "Scenarios" button and select "Water Main Break".)**

**Operator:** "But what about emergencies? Let's trigger a sudden water main break."

**(Action: A new, "Critical" incident appears on the map with a large red pulse.)**

**Operator:** "The system detected the anomaly in seconds. But how did this event unfold? Let's use our **Replay Mode**."

**(Action: Go to the Replay Mode screen. A timeline is at the bottom. Scrub the timeline back 60 seconds.)**

**Operator:** "I can scrub back in time and see exactly how the event was detected... how the AI first flagged it as an 'anomaly'... and then escalated it to a 'critical incident' and dispatched emergency crews, all in under 5 seconds."

**Operator:** "This is CivicPulse AI. We're not just building smart cities. We're building **autonomous** ones."
