# 🚀 CivicPulse AI: 3-Minute Pitch Outline

---

### Slide 1: Title & Hook (15 seconds)
* **Title:** CivicPulse AI
* **Subtitle:** The Autonomous AI Brain for Your Smart City
* **Hook:** "Right now, every city in the world is managed by waiting for something to break. We built an AI that stops problems *before* they happen."

---

### Slide 2: The Problem (30 seconds)
* **Title:** Our Cities are Reactive, Not Proactive
* **Key Points:**
    * Trash overflows, streetlights fail, water pipes leak...
    * These "micro-incidents" cost billions and frustrate citizens.
    * The current model? **Wait for a complaint, then send a truck.**
* **Visual:** Side-by-side images:  vs. a clean, efficient city street.

### Slide 3: The Solution (30 seconds)
* **Title:** Introducing CivicPulse AI
* **The "One-Liner":** "A real-time digital twin that detects, predicts, and resolves city issues autonomously."
* **How it Works (3 Icons):**
    1.  **VISUALIZE:** A live "health map" of the entire city.
    2.  **PREDICT:** AI forecasts failures hours or days in advance.
    3.  **ACT:** Agentic AI autonomously plans and dispatches (simulated) work orders.

### Slide 4: LIVE DEMO (1 minute 15 seconds)
* **(This is the most important part)**
* **"This isn't a mockup. This is the live system."**
* **Demo Flow:**
    1.  Show the **Digital Twin Dashboard**: "Here is the live health of our city. We're monitoring hundreds of sensors for waste, water, and lighting."
    2.  Show a **Prediction**: "Our AI has just predicted a trash overflow in 'Zone A' *before* it happened."
    3.  Show the **Agent Console**: "Instantly, our AI agents are collaborating. The **Planner** sees the risk. The **Dispatcher** has autonomously created a work order. You can read its 'thoughts' right here."
    4.  Trigger a **Scenario** (e.g., "Flood"): "Let's simulate a crisis. We've triggered a water main break."
    5.  Show the **Replay Mode**: "The system detected it instantly. And with our replay feature, we can scrub back in time and see exactly how the event unfolded and how our AI responded in seconds."

### Slide 5: The Hackathon & Vision (15 seconds)
* **Themes:** Smart & Sustainable City, Digital Economy.
* **What We Built in 24 Hours:** "We built a full-stack, production-ready microservice platform with a real-time frontend, a streaming backend, and a multi-agent AI system."
* **Vision:** "This is the future of city operations—autonomous, predictive, and efficient."

### Slide 6: Thank You / Ask (15 seconds)
* **Title:** Thank You
* **Team:** [Your Names]
* **Ask:** "We're looking for partners to help us pilot this with a real city."
